# Colorado Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
The Colorado Board of Elections wanted to know if Python programming language would be a viable option for delivering and analyzing election results.  They requested the following tasks in order to complete the election audit of a recent election using Python:

1.  Calculate the total number of votes
2.  Provide a complete list of counties
3.  Calculate voter turnout for each county
4.  Calculate percentage of votes for each county out of the total number of votes
5.  Provide the county with the hightest voter turnout
6.  Provide a complete list of candidates
7.  Calculate the total number of votes that each candidate received
8.  Calculate the percentage of the total votes for each candidate
9.  Determine the winner of the elction based on popular vote

## Election Audit Summary
Python programming language is a viable option for delivering and analyzing election results. Its versatility would also allow for results to be calculated on a smaller scale by precinct or on a larger scale by House Districts.  Analyses could also be performed by party affiliation and other demographic data.  Results could also be presented alphabetically by county.
